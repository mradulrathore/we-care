## About The Project

A platform which acts as both- a guide and a saviour.
As a guide, we aim at providing a useful tool where women can learn self defence techniques, get knowledge of safety products which they can carry with them during any outdoor trip. All this can be done in their free time and by this they can prepare themselves for future safety.

As a savior, we aim at providing an easy-to-use interface with multiple features which can be used  according to the seriousness of the situation in case of any emergency in order to help them escape any unfortunate situation safely.
